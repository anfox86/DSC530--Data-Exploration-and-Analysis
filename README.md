## Does a State's Poverty Level Affect SNF Medicare Reimbursements
This project looked at Medicare data for SNF (Skilled Nursing Facilities) in the year 2015. 

### Description
The goal was to find out whether the top 10 poorest states received a higher or lower reimbursement from Medicare compared to the top 10 wealthiest states. This consisted of finding a resource that listed which states were either higher or lower in poverty level for that specific year.  I then needed to create two subsets dataframes to look at rates of reimbursements.
